# Task Management and Team Collaboration Tool

To start your Spring Boot backend, follow these steps:

```sh
mvn clean package
```
This will generate a `.jar` file inside the `target/` folder.

---

### **3. Start the Backend**
There are **two ways** to start your backend:

#### âœ… **Option 1: Run with Maven**
Run the following command from the backend folder:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This will start your Spring Boot application.

#### âœ… **Option 2: Run the JAR file**
If you built the JAR file, run it using:
```sh
java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
(Replace `demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` with your actual JAR file name)

---

### **4. Check if the Server is Running**
Once the backend starts successfully, you should see logs indicating that it is running on a port, typically **8080**:
```
Tomcat started on port(s): 8080
```
Verify by opening a browser and visiting:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
or test an endpoint like:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/your-endpoint
```

---

### **5. Stop the Backend (if needed)**
To stop the server, press **`Ctrl + C`** in the terminal.
